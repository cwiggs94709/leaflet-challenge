# leaflet-challenge
This project focuses on visualizing earthquake data using the USGS GeoJSON feed. It involves fetching real-time earthquake data from a provided URL and displaying this data on a map created with Leaflet. Here are the key features of the visualization:

Mapping Earthquakes: The application plots earthquakes based on their geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude).
Data Markers: Markers on the map represent earthquakes, scaled in size according to the earthquake's magnitude and colored based on the depth of the earthquake. Larger markers denote higher magnitudes, and darker colors indicate greater depths.
Interactive Popups: Clicking on a marker displays a popup with additional details about the earthquake, providing insights into its magnitude, depth, and exact location.
Legend Integration: A legend is included on the map to help users understand the scale of magnitude and depth represented by the marker sizes and colors.
The project aims to provide an intuitive and informative way to visualize the frequency, magnitude, and depth of earthquakes globally, enhancing the understanding of seismic activities through interactive mapping.
